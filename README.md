# Simon Game
This repository contains the code for building a Simon Game.
- For this project I used **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**.

## Description
The Simon game is a classic memory and pattern recognition game brought to life on the web. 
It challenges your memory skills and requires your full attention to follow the ever-growing sequence of button presses and tones.

## How to Play:
- You'll see a colorful game board with four buttons, each representing a different color: red, green, blue, and yellow.
- The game starts with a simple sequence, lighting up one of the buttons and playing a corresponding sound.
- Your goal is to replicate the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order they were shown.
- If you get it right, the game adds another step to the sequence. Keep going to test the limits of your memory!
